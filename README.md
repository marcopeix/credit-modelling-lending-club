# Credit Modelling

In this project, we focus on credit modelling, which is a common data science problem. For this purpose, we will work with data collected from the Lending Club.

The Lending Club is a marketplace where borrowers and investors meet. On one side, investors may lend their money for an interest rate ranging from 5% to 30%. On the other side, borrowers can borrow money and repay their loans in up to 6 months.

Considering the investor's point of view, we want to avoid people that will default on their loan. 

**Objective:** Create a machine learning model to allow a conservative investor to avoid people that will default on their loans.
